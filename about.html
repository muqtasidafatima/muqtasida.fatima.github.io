        <p>Hi! I am Muqtasida Fatima, a school-going girl who is fond of nature and loves taking pictures of beautiful sceneries or natural elements. Being a nature-lover, I also like to travel around and seek for adventures. Till now, I have done only couple activities that are adventurous. For example, I have gone for nature hike, canoeing, camping every summer, and ziplining. One of the daring activity in my adventure list is to do sky diving. Other than small adventures, I like to play piano in my spare time which gives peace to my heart and love playing and watching soccer. I am also very fond of animals and in future would like to have as many pets as possible.</p>
        
        <p>All the ones mentioned above are some of the other hobbies that I have. From which, photography is my favourite hobby that I would like to continue in future. Please feel free to drop any comments or feedbacks for the posted photos. </p>
